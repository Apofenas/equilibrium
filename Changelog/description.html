<html><head/><body><p><span style=" font-size:12pt; font-weight:600; ">Equilibrium Balance Mod </span></p><p>The purpose of this mod is to fix the existing issues with the game, and make improvements to gameplay by increasing its strategic diversity, while keeping the overall feel of the game the same and familiar, <b>so you don't need to relearn the game to play this mod.</b></p><li><b>All</b> units are now useful - and not just in one specific way, you can now build beetles for things <b>other</b> than snipes! <li>Veterancy overhaul. No more crazy instant-healing, all units gain vet points based on mass killed, and level up based on their own mass price.<li>Experimentals are no longer a cheese unit. Thanks to the veterancy changes, and build-time adjustments they are a true T4 unit, not some win/mass donate mechanism.<li>Choice is now a thing in this game! No longer is it obviously good to build one unit at a time or play the same way every match. You now have options available to you at all stages of the game. Try new things, be creative, there's plenty of room for that in this mod.<p> Lastly, if you are interested, be sure to check out the complete changelog on the FAF forums for a complete list of changes, as well as leaving feedback for us!</body></html>
